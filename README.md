# Number-Converter
# By Joshua Meritt

This is a number convert that has a list of options that can be done; bin2dec(num) takes a binary number and converts it to decimal, 
dec2bin(num) takes a decimal number and converts it to binary, unarycode(num) takes a decimal and turns it to unary code, and gammacode(num)
takes a decimal number and then returns the gammacode for it.
